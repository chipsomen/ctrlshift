            <p>There once was a man called Galileo Galilei, who revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos. By improving the telescope, he made groundbreaking discoveries, including the phases of Venus and Jupiter's moons, which supported the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus. Said heliocentric model states that Earth and the rest of the planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the universe. This was in direct opposition to the geocentric model endorsed by the Catholic Church, which placed Earth at the center of the universe with all other planets, including the Sun, revolving around Earth.
